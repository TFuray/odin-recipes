    <img src="../images/beef_broccoli.jpg" alt="Beef and Broccoli Dish">
    <p>Ever since we moved to Hollywood, Jason and I have been ordering delivery several times a week. There are tons of
        fun
        restaurants we’re just dying to try out but once we get home, we’re just too tired to leave the house again.
        Plus,
        Butters makes it really difficult for us to leave.

        But as convenient as delivery is, I just can’t keep waiting 60-90 mins for them to come! Plus, the food is
        always cold
        by the time it hits our table. So when I had a beef and broccoli craving the other day – a craving I have at
        least once
        a week I just had to try Carrian’s easy version of this.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>soy sauce</li>
        <li>chick stock</li>
        <li>honey</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
        <li>spices</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together soy sauce, chicken stock, honey, vinegar, brown sugar, garlic, sesame
            oil, cornstarch,
            Sriracha, ginger, red pepper flakes and 1/4 cup water; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add steak and cook, flipping once, until
            browned, about 3-4
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in broccoli and soy sauce mixture until tender and slightly thickened, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately</li>
    </ol>
